This directory contains test data for verifying certificate chains.

It contains the following types of files:

===============================
generate-*.py
===============================

Generates the file for an individual test case. If the python file was
named generate-XXX.py, then the corresponding output will be named
XXX.pem.

===============================
generate-all.sh
===============================

Runs all of the generate-*.py scripts and does some cleanup.

===============================
*.pem
===============================

These files descibe a test case for certificate chain verification.

The input file is a PEM file with blocks for:
  * The trust store
  * The certificate chain (target certificate and all intermediaries)
  * The timestamp to use when verifying
  * The expected result of verification (success or fail)
