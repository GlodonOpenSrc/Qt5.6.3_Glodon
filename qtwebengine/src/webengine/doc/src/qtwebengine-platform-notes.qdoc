    \title Qt WebEngine Platform Notes

    \brief Contains information about issues that are specific to the Qt WebEngine module.

    \section1 Building Qt WebEngine from Source

    Static builds are not supported.

    The requirements for building Qt 5 modules from source are listed separately for each supported
    platform:

    \list
        \li \l{Qt for Windows - Requirements}
        \li \l{Qt for X11 Requirements}
        \li \l{Qt for macOS - Requirements}
    \endlist

    In addition, the following tools are required for building the \l {Qt WebEngine} module:

    \list
        \li \l {All Platforms}
        \li \l {Windows}
        \li \l {Linux}
        \li \l {macOS}
    \endlist

    The tests for skipping the Qt WebEngine build are located in the
    \c qtwebengine repository, in the \c tools\qmake\mkspecs subdirectory.
    They can be found by searching for \c skipBuild.

    \section2 All Platforms

    On all platforms, the following tools are required:

    \list
        \li \l Python 2.7 or later
        \li Bison, Flex
        \li GPerf
    \endlist

    \section2 Windows

    On Windows, Visual Studio 2013 or Visual Studio 2015 is required.

    \section2 Linux

    On Linux, Clang or GCC version 4.7 or later is required.
    Supported configurations are \c linux-g++ and \c{linux-clang}.

    Qt WebEngine requires \c pkg-config to detect most of its dependencies. The
    following \c pkg-config files are required:

    \list
        \li \c dbus-1
        \li \c fontconfig
    \endlist

    If Qt was configured for \c xcb, the following \c pkg-config files are also
    required:

    \list
        \li \c libdrm
        \li \c xcomposite
        \li \c xcursor
        \li \c xi
        \li \c xrandr
        \li \c xscrnsaver
        \li \c xtst
    \endlist

    Further, development packages for \c khr and \c libcap need to be installed.

    \section2 \macos

    On \macos, the following are required:

    \list
        \li \macos 10.9 or later
        \li Xcode 6.1 or later
        \li \macos 10.10 SDK or later
    \endlist

    \note Qt WebEngine cannot be built for the 32-bit mode of \macos (using the
    \c macx-clang-32 \c mkspec).

    \section1 Mac App Store Compatibility

    By default, Qt WebEngine uses private OS X API, which might cause an application to be
    rejected when submitted to the Mac App Store. To configure Qt WebEngine not to use these API
    calls, Qt WebEngine has to be recompiled:

    \code
    qmake WEBENGINE_CONFIG+=use_appstore_compliant_code
    \endcode

    However, this will cause some behavioral changes, such as:

    \list
        \li The OS X Kill Ring functionality will no longer work (emacs-like copy pasting).
        \li Certain Chromium sandboxing cleanup is not done.
        \li Text areas will be painted with a different style.
        \li Text fields might be painted with a different style on Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).
    \endlist

    \section1 Default QSurfaceFormat OpenGL Profile Support

    If a new default QSurfaceFormat with a modified OpenGL profile has to be set, it should be set
    before the application instance is declared, to make sure that all created OpenGL contexts use
    the same OpenGL profile.

    On \macos, if the default QSurfaceFormat is set after the application instance, the application
    will exit with qFatal(), and print a message that the default QSurfaceFormat should be set
    before the application instance.
