    \class QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler
    \brief The QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler is a base class for handling custom URL schemes.
    \since 5.6

    To implement a custom URL scheme for QtWebEngine, you must write a class derived from this class,
    and reimplement requestStarted().

    \inmodule QtWebEngineCore

*/

/*!
    Constructs a new URL scheme handler.

    The handler is created with the parent \a parent.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler::requestStarted(QWebEngineUrlRequestJob *request)

    This method is called whenever a request \a request for the registered scheme is started.

    This method must be reimplemented by all custom URL scheme handlers.
    The request is asynchronous and does not need to be handled right away.
